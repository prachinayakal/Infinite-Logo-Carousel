2. Include the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in your project.
3. Customize the logos by replacing the images in the `logo/` directory with your own logos.

## How it Works

The Infinite Logo Carousel is achieved through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- HTML: The structure of the carousel is defined in `index.html`, where logos are placed within a container.
- CSS: The styles for the carousel, including animations and responsiveness, are defined in `styles.css`.
- JavaScript: The script in `index.html` clones the logos to create an infinite loop effect.

## Customization

You can customize the Infinite Logo Carousel in several ways:

- Change the logos: Replace the images in the `logo/` directory with your own logo images.
- Adjust the styles: Modify the CSS in `styles.css` to change the appearance and behavior of the carousel.
- Extend functionality: Add more features or animations using additional JavaScript.
